    <h1>Quote One from Winston Churchill </h1>
    <p id="b">
        Criticism may not be agreeable, but it is necessary. It fulfils the same function as pain in the human body. It calls attention
        to an unhealthy state of things.

        <h3 id="b">Quote Two from Winston Churchill </h3>

        <p >
            Courage is rightly esteemed the first of human qualities... because it is the quality which guarantees all others. Courage
            is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.
        </p>

            Continuous effort - not strength or intelligence - is the key to unlocking our potential.

            The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest cat species, reaching a total body length of up to 3.3 metres (11 ft) and weighing
            up to 306 kg (670 lb). It is the third largest land carnivore (behind only the Polar bear and the Brown bear).
            Its most recognizable feature is a pattern of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with lighter underparts.
            It has exceptionally stout teeth, and the canines are the longest among living felids with a crown height of
            as much as 74.5 mm (2.93 in) or even 90 mm (3.5 in). [4] <img src="tiger1.jpg"> In zoos, tigers have lived for 20 to 26 years, which
            also seems to be their longevity in the wild.[5] They are territorial and generally solitary but social animals,
            often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support their prey requirements. This, coupled with the
            fact that they are indigenous to some of the more densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts
            with humans. Tigers once ranged widely across Asia, from Turkey in the west to the eastern coast of Russia. Over
            the past 100 years, they have lost 93% of their historic range, and have been extirpated from southwest and central
            Asia, from the islands of Java and Bali, and from large areas of Southeast and Eastern Asia. Today, they range
            from the Siberian taiga to open grasslands and tropical mangrove swamps. The remaining six tiger subspecies have
            been classified as endangered by IUCN. The global population in the wild is estimated to number between 3,062
            to 3,948 individuals, down from around 100,000 at the start of the 20th century,[6] with most remaining populations
            occurring in small pockets that are isolated from each other. Major reasons for population decline include habitat
            destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching.[1] The extent of area occupied by tigers is estimated at less
            than 1,184,911 km2 (457,497 sq mi), a 41% decline from the area estimated in the mid-1990s.[7]
